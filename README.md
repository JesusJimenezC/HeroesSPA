# HeroesSPA

## Description

HeroesSPA is a web application created with the intention of exploring and learning about React. In this application, you can view a list of some heroes from DC and Marvel. The main purpose of the project is to experiment with various functionalities and tools in React, such as:

- **useReducer**: Managing application state in a more complex way.
- **Routing**: Navigating between different views of the application.
- **Private and Public Routes**: Managing access to certain routes based on user authentication status.
- **TypeScript**: Utilizing static typing to improve code quality.
- **ESLint Configurations**: Maintaining a consistent and clean code standard.

## Features

- **Simple Login**: Implementation of a basic (hardcoded) login to simulate route protection and manage logged-in users.
- **Heroes List**: Viewing heroes from DC and Marvel.
- **Protected Routes**: Access to certain parts of the application only for authenticated users.
